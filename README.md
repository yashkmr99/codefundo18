Natural disaster prediction and management app for codefundo++ 2018

Idea :

- The app will require access to user location and Read/Send SMS permission.
- The app will have a "Call for Help" button which will send user's location details or the coordinates through sms(for no internet connectivity) to his relatives and friends.
- The relatives or friends can upload their location to stranded people database.
- The relief or support groups can view all the stranded people marked on a map.
- There will be a map showing shelter locations for stranded people. We can also send the coordinates of shelter locations through sms which they can view on Map.
- There will be "Do's and Dont's" section to guide them.

More things to add :

- We will use the predicted data given by government websites (like NHC) to warn people about predictable natural disasters like Hurricane based on their location. 
- There will be a section where you can interact with people stranded nearby. Eg- You can broadcast message to nearby users about shelter locations.
